Basicallly, I:

1. Made a directory with mkdir.
2. Then I used touch to make files in this directory.
3. Then I staged these changes with git add.
4. Then I checked these stages with git status.
5. Then I committed these changes with git commit - m "message".
6. Then I made a remote repository with git remote add origin https://github.com/<github username>/<github repo name>.git.
5. Then I pushed the changes I had made to the remote repository with git push origin master.
6. Then I checked and confirmed that all my changes were on my github site, and they were.
